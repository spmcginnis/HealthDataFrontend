<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>I created this Angular app in my personal time to consume the API I made for my LaunchCode capstone project.  The API project files are stored in  <a href="https://github.com/spmcginnis/sample-HealthDataAPI">this repo</a>. As the API is not hosted, the demo app instead consumes a flat file version of the data and some functionality has been disabled.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>Imagine a hospital administrator who was to decide how to allocate funding for serving non-English speaking patients.  This app provides a view for that administrator to see which language speaking patients use what hospitals.</p>
<h2>About the data</h2>
<p>None of the data belongs to real people.  But the data is based on real standards and statistics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The hospitals were selected because they are the largest in the region by number of beds.</li>
        <li>The data fields were derived from a CCD-XML template, in following C-CDA 2.0, a healthcare data standard certified by the American National Standards Institute.</li>
        <li>The fake names were generated using the Python names library. I found that the names appeared too real, so I appended the prefix "fake-" to eliminate any confusion of this data for the data of real people.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>The Map Page</h2>
<p>At this point, the map page mereley consists of a Leaflet.js map of the region.  Down the road, I plan to add data visualizations to the map that would aid our imaginary administrator.</p>
